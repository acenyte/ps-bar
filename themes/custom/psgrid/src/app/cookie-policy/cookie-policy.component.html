    <h2 class="heading">WHAT ARE COOKIES? </h2>
    <p class="text">
        A cookie is a tiny data file which is stored on your computer within the web browser when certain web pages
        are visited. A cookie does not contain or collect information in isolation, but when read by a server via a web
        browser, it can give information to facilitate a more <u>user friendly</u> service such as detecting errors. A
        cookie
        will not harm your computer, and no personally identifiable information is stored from the use of this site.
        <br><br>
        To use our website fully, you will need to have cookies enabled. If you do not wish to enable cookies, you can
        still browse the site; however certain features of the site may be limited. Most web browsers have cookies
        automatically enabled.
        <br><br>
        This information is outlined as part of our efforts to comply with recent legislation and to ensure that we are
        open, honest and clear about user privacy. Please refer to our <a href="https://www.cadbury.co.za/privacy">Privacy

    <h2 class="heading">HOW WE USE COOKIES</h2>
    <p class="text">
        You may notice the presence of different types of cookies generated on your visit to this website. We use three
        types of cookies:
    </p>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>
            Session cookies, which are automatically deleted after every visit
        </li>
        <li>
            Persistent cookies that will remain in place during multiple visits to the site
        </li>
        <li>
            Third-party cookies, which are used by partner websites that are embedded within our site or that we link
            to
        </li>

    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2 class="heading">SESSION COOKIES</h2>
    <p class="text">
        These enable you to perform essential functions on the site, such as remembering a repeat form field item
        within a browsing session. In addition, they help by limiting the need to transfer information across the
        internet. They are not stored on your computer and will expire when you terminate your browser session.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="heading">PERSISTENT COOKIES</h2>
    <p class="text">
        These enable us to recognise anonymous repeat visitors to the site. By matching an anonymous, randomly
        generated identifier, a record can be taken of specific browsing information such as how you arrive at the
        site, the pages you view, options you select and the path taken through the site. By monitoring this
        information, we’re able to make improvements to the site, including the fixing of errors and the enhancement of
        content.<br><br>
        We use Adobe Omniture SiteCatalyst software to analyse page use, page interactions and the routes taken through
        our sites. These are known as 'website metrics' or ‘analytics’. We do not record any personal information as
        part of this process.
